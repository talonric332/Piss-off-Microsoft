# Piss-off-Microsoft and Google
Curated host-based blocklists aimed at silencing Microsoft, Google and other
telemetry or advertising domains. Think of them as digital duct tape that keeps
your computer from tattling about your every click. With these lists in place,
Windows update beacons, OneDrive callbacks, Office clickstream collection, ad
servers and other analytics noise quietly vanish into the void.

## List Maintenance
The blocklists in this repository are periodically refreshed from upstream
sources and curated by the community. Import them into AdGuard Home, Pi-hole or
uBlock Origin to cut down unwanted telemetry.

## Block Lists

Below is a brief description of each list provided in this repository and what it is used for.

- **Microsoft_Tracking_Blocklist.txt** – Because Windows loves to tattle, this mega-list tries to muzzle every nosy domain Microsoft dreams up.
- **Slimmed_Microsoft_Blocklist.txt** – A lighter touch that keeps Xbox updates humming while still shutting down the worst of Redmond's snoops.
- **General_Blocking_Rules.txt** – A sampler platter of the biggest trackers from across the web—perfect for a no-fuss privacy boost.
- **Samsung_Tracker_Blocklist_Cleaned.txt** – Tell your Galaxy phone to quit gossiping with Samsung's servers and enjoy some peace and quiet.
- **Mobile_Game_Ads_Blocklist.txt** – Eliminates those endless pop-ups so you can focus on crushing levels, not closing banners.
- **Adult_Content_Blocklist.txt** – Keeps your network squeaky clean by sweeping away domains you'd rather not explain to grandma.
- **Google_Gemini_Blocklist.txt** – Targets the cosmic constellation of Gemini trackers so Google's AI can't follow you everywhere.
- **Meta_Allowlist.txt** – Lets Facebook and Instagram through because sometimes you just have to see those cat photos and memes.
- **Home_Automation_Allowlist.txt** – Keeps smart lights and robot vacuums on speaking terms with their cloud overlords while blocking the chatterboxes.
- **Gaming_Allowlist.txt** – Makes sure the big gaming services stay online so you never miss an update—or a headshot.
