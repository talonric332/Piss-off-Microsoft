# Piss-off-Microsoft and Google
Blocklist to obliterate Microsoft Copilot, Bing, and telemetry.

## What Luckless Does
Luckless merges and maintains host-based blocklists aimed at shutting off Microsoft and Google tracking. The lists can be used with tools like AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, or uBlock Origin to keep unwanted telemetry at bay.
