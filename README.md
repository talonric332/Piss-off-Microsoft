# Piss-off-Microsoft and Google
Blocklist to obliterate Microsoft Copilot, Bing, and the mountains of telemetry they ride in on. That includes Windows update beacons, OneDrive call‑homes, Office clickstream collection, advertising servers, and other assorted analytics noise.

## What Luckless Does
Luckless merges and maintains host-based blocklists aimed at shutting off Microsoft and Google tracking. The lists can be used with tools like AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, or uBlock Origin to keep unwanted telemetry at bay.
