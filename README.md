# Piss-off-Microsoft and Google
Blocklist to obliterate Microsoft Copilot, Bing, and the mountains of telemetry they ride in on. That includes Windows update beacons, OneDrive call‑homes, Office clickstream collection, advertising servers, and other assorted analytics noise.

## What Luckless Does
Luckless merges and maintains host-based blocklists aimed at shutting off Microsoft and Google tracking. The lists can be used with tools like AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, or uBlock Origin to keep unwanted telemetry at bay.

## Using These Lists
Use the raw links above to grab any list and import it into your ad blocker of choice. Many folks just paste them into AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, or uBlock Origin. Check back often—Microsoft loves to roll out new endpoints. If you're on AdGuard Home, set your filter update interval to **1 hour** so you always fetch the latest changes.

## Why So Serious?
Sure, the repo name is a bit cheeky, but the goal is simple: reclaim a little privacy. If our lists help you out and make you chuckle, that's a win-win.
