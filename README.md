# Piss-off-Microsoft and Google
Curated host-based blocklists aimed at silencing Microsoft, Google and other

analytics traffic.

## List Maintenance
The blocklists in this repository are periodically refreshed from upstream
sources and curated by the community. Import them into AdGuard Home, Pi-hole or
uBlock Origin to cut down unwanted telemetry.
